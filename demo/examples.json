    "content": "Jeremy Corbyn has been mocked by own MPs after saying Russia should be given a sample of the nerve agent used in the Salisbury attack so it can \"say categorically one way or the other\" whether it is responsible.\\nThe Labour leader also said he would be happy to work with President Putin if he was Prime Minister and stopped short of blaming the Kremlin for the attack, despite his deputy John McDonnell doing so over the weekend.\\nIt exposes a deepening split in the party's position on the nerve agent attack which has left Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in a coma in hospital.\\nLast week Mr Corbyn was criticised for refusing to categorically blame Russia for the Novichok poisoning and his communications chief drew further ire when he claimed British intelligence cannot be trusted after the Iraq war dossier.\\nResponding to his latest remarks on the issue Mr Corbyn was roundly mocked by his own MPs including Ian Austin, a member of the Foreign Affairs select committee, who joked that Mr Putin would never accuse himself of having smuggled the nerve agent into the UK to use against the former spy.\\nHe said: \"Does anyone seriously think Putin will say: \u2018Thanks for the sample. We have now examined it and yes, I'm sorry to say that it did come from Russia and was then given to one of our agents to murder Mr Skripal in the way we have murdered lots of other opponents\u2019? Who thinks that?\u201d\\nSpeaking to the BBC's World and One programme Mr Corbyn said: \"All fingers point towards Russia's involvement in this, and obviously the manufacture of the material was undertaken by the Russian state originally.\\n\"What I'm saying is the weapons were made from Russia, clearly.\\n\"I think Russia has to be held responsible for it but there has to be an absolutely definitive answer to the question where did the nerve agent come from? I asked the Russians be given a sample so that they can say categorically one way or the other.\"\\nIn a move that is likely to spark further frustration among Labout MPs Mr Corbyn maintained there had to be a relationship with Russia and said he would still \"do business\" with president Putin if Labour came to power.\\n\"Would I do business with Putin, sure? And I'd challenge him on human rights in Russia, challenge him on these issues and challenge him on that whole basis of that relationship,\" he said.\\nJohn Woodcock, chair of Labour's backbench foreign affairs committee, warned allowing Russia to test the poison would be \"like saying you trust the fairness of Putin's re-election because he told you it was fine\".\\nHe added: \"Russia denies every single assassination attempt on foreign soil, no matter how blatant.\\n\"In what parallel universe would we think sending Putin's regime a sample of their poison would lend more credibility to this latest denial?\"\\nIt came as Theresa May chaired a meeting of the National Security Council to discuss additional sanctions on Russia after the Kremlin ejected 23 British diplomats from the country. 23 Russian officials, thought to be undeclared spies, left the UK today.\\nThe Prime Minister told the meeting: \"There are other measures that government and security officials are actively considering and stand ready to deploy at any time.\"\\nShe revealed action has been taken at the UK border to beef up visa checks, particularly for private flights, and amendments to the sanctions and money laundering bill are also taking shape.\\nA spokesman for Mrs May said: \"The Prime Minister reiterated that we will freeze Russian state assets wherever we have evidence that they may threaten UK persons or property. And, led by the National Crime Agency, we will continue to bring all the capabilities of the UK law enforcement to bear against serial criminals and corrupt elites.\""

    "content": "SNP ministers would be banned from using the swathe of new powers they will receive after Brexit to fracture the UK\u2019s internal market, under Tory proposals for a \u201cUnion guarantee\u201d.\\nThe Conservatives are to table an amendment to the Scottish Government\u2019s Brexit Continuity Bill that would prevent ministers introducing rules and regulations that would hinder free trade with the rest of the UK.\\nThey will argue that the safeguard is needed to ensure Scottish companies continue to have \u201cfree and frictionless access\u201d to their most important market, which is worth four times their trade with the rest of the EU.\\nSpeaking ahead of the controversial Bill clearing its final parliamentary hurdle on Wednesday, Adam Tomkins, the party\u2019s constitution spokesman, challenged SNP, Labour and Liberal Democrat MSPs to back the amendment.\\nLabour last night attacked the amendment as \u201cjaw-droppingly shamless\u201d but they and the Lib Dems refused to rule out supporting it. Mike Russell, the SNP\u2019s Brexit Minister, described it as \u201cyet another stealth attack by the Tories on devolution.\"\\nNicola Sturgeon\u2019s administration has previously acknowledged that UK-wide frameworks will be required after Brexit for policy areas such as food labelling to enable free cross-Border trade of goods and services.\\nThe UK Government\u2019s EU Withdrawal Bill proposes creating the frameworks in 24 areas but Ms Sturgeon has so far refused to support the legislation, claiming it represents a \u201cpower grab\u201d because her consent to the provisions would not be required.\\nSNP ministers have tabled their own Continuity Bill as a contingency for no deal being reached, with the legislation being rushed through Holyrood on an emergency timetable.\\nUnveiling his amendment, Mr Tomkins, a constitutional law professor, said: \u201cThe rest of the UK is Scotland\u2019s biggest marketplace. Whatever else happens with Brexit, we must ensure we do nothing that damages access to it.\\n\u201cWe are opposed to the SNP\u2019s Wrecking Bill because we fear it will do just that. That\u2019s why our amendment is necessary.\u201d He argued that all parties should be able to support the amendment, regardless of their stance on independence.\\nHis amendment would insert a new section at the start of the SNP\u2019s Continuity Bill enshrining the \u201cprinciple of protecting (the) UK domestic market.\u201d\\nIt defines the latter term as \u201cthe body of shared regulations, practices, case law and enactments that provide for the free movement of goods, capital, services and labour\u201d across the UK.\\nScottish ministers would be banned from passing any legislation or regulation that would result in any \u201cregulatory divergence materially damaging the ability\u201d of people or businesses to trade freely with the rest of the UK.\\nThey would also be prevented from doing anything that \u201crestricts the free movement of goods, capital, services or labour\u201d across the four home nations.\\nBut Mr Russell attacked the Tories, saying: \u201cIf they can't take Scotland's powers away, they want to prevent us using them. When as they know well, there are already differences in key policy areas which do not prevent trade within these islands or beyond it.\u201d\\nA Scottish Labour spokesman said: \u201cThis attempt by Ruth Davidson to put a sticking plaster over her party's attack on devolution is jaw-droppingly shameless.\\n\"It is the Tories who have caused the whole disastrous Brexit situation - and their shambolic handling of the negotiations continue to make a bad situation worse.\u201d\\nA Scottish Lib Dems spokesman said they have also tabled amendments to protect the UK single market but said they wanted power to be shared \u201cwith neither the Scottish Government or UK Government gaining a monopoly.\u201d"
